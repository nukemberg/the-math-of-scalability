## Abstract
We often hear talks of “scale”, mostly based on personal experience and lessons learned. What can Mathematics tell us about scale? Can math help us scale our systems and companies?It turns out that probability, statistics and other domains can help…

This talk aims to promote the use of math and statistics in system design and analysis. The talk presents several mathematical models relevant to system scalability and lessons from them - lessons that are otherwise learnt through years of disaster fraught experience. The talk covers Queue theory, Universal Scalability Law, the Law of Truly Large Numbers, probabilistic scaling effects (why failures scale better than success) and more!
